Approval workflow

Submitting Data for Approval
-----------------------------
1. All data that is pending submission for approval will appear on the pending submission tab. Note that you will need to select different questionnaires to see **pending submissions** for each questionnaire. This is to avoid batching data from different questionnaires in one batch for approval which is not valid.
